# AirBnB Clone Project: Web Static

Upon completion of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without relying on Google:

1. **HTML**:
   - Definition: HyperText Markup Language, used to structure content on the web.
   - Creation: Write HTML code using text editors like VSCode or Sublime Text.
   
2. **Markup Language**:
   - Definition: A system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text.
   
3. **DOM**:
   - Definition: Document Object Model, a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.
   
4. **Element/Tag**:
   - Element/Tag: Building blocks of HTML pages, denoted by opening and closing tags (e.g., `<div></div>`).
   
5. **Attribute**:
   - Definition: Additional information provided within a tag to modify or define its behavior or properties (e.g., `class`, `id`, `src`).
   
6. **Browser Page Loading**:
   - Process: The browser loads a webpage by sending a request to the server, which responds with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. The browser then renders these files to display the webpage.
   
7. **CSS**:
   - Definition: Cascading Style Sheets, used to style the appearance of HTML elements on a webpage.
   
8. **Adding Style to Elements**:
   - Method: Define CSS rules with selectors targeting specific HTML elements, classes, or IDs, and specify desired styles (e.g., color, font-size).
   
9. **Class**:
   - Definition: A way to apply the same styles to multiple elements on a webpage by assigning them a common class attribute.
   
10. **Selector**:
    - Definition: A pattern used to select and style one or more elements on a webpage.
    
11. **CSS Specificity Value**:
    - Definition: A value used to determine which CSS rule takes precedence when multiple rules apply to the same element. It is calculated based on the combination of selectors used.
    
12. **Box Properties in CSS**:
    - Definition: Properties that control the layout and sizing of HTML elements, including width, height, padding, border, and margin. These properties define the visual box model of an element.

Understanding these concepts is essential for effectively creating and styling webpages in HTML and CSS.
